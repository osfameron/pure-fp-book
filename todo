docpatches
    - MXMS slurpy %opts handling
           including not mixing these at *all*!

code
    Data::Thunk::Moosey->lazy_moose
        as per doy, this will check does_role
        (which may require a patch to Moose, that he's looking at)

pseudopod
    O<foo.png> required for App::pod2pdf, but this makes the HTML
    parser cry.  How best to deal with this?
