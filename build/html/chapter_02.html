<h2>Linked lists</h2>

<p>The linked list is one of the oldest data structures in computing, dating back to the mid-1950s. While it's a collection type, similar to an Array, it makes very different tradeoffs.</p>

<p>In a dynamic programming language like Perl, Ruby, Python, of Javascript, we very rarely feel the need to look beyond the builtin array types, as they are usually Good Enough. However, the linked list <i>is</i> a fundamental building block, and we'll see that it is key for understanding concepts such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>recursive thinking

<li>data-sharing

<li>persistent data structures

</ul>

<p>Beyond this, linked lists do have some features that arrays don't</p>

<ul>

<li>handling circular data

<li>infinite lists and streams

<li>possibility for automatic parallelisation

</ul>

<p>A linked list is a structure that contains an element (often called the <code>head</code>) and a pointer to the rest of the list (the <code>tail</code>).</p>

<p>For example, the word <code>"hello"</code> is made up of the list of characters:</p>

<pre><code>    [h.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o ]
     ^    ^
   head   tail</code></pre>

<p>The head is the letter <code>"h"</code>, and the tail is the list</p>

<pre><code>    [e.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o ]</code></pre>

<p>So we've seen lists of 4 and 5 elements. You could grow the list arbitrarily large, by continuing to add links to new elements.</p>

<p>How about smaller lists?</p>

<pre><code>    1 element:   [o ]
    0 elements:  ()</code></pre>

<p>The 0-element list doesn't have a head or a tail. It's just an empty list. But how about the 1-element list? It has a <code>head</code>, but does it have a <code>tail</code>?</p>

<p>Well, we saw that the tail of the list <code>"hello"</code> was the list <code>"ello"</code>. So the tail of <code>"o"</code> should be the list <code>""</code>, i.e. the empty list.</p>

<p>This means that really our lists look like:</p>

<pre><code>    [o.]-&gt;()

    [h.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o.]-&gt;()</code></pre>

<p>Which means that all lists have a head <i>and</i> a tail. Unless they're the empty list, which has neither. i.e. a list can be one of two things:</p>

<pre><code>    ()      the empty list
    [x.]-&gt;  a linking cell the connects a value to another list
            (where the other list is either another linking cell
            or an empty list)</code></pre>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Let's have a look now at how we could represent this in code. As usual, we'll look at examples in Modern Perl. We'll add code and explanations in Ruby, Python, and JavaScript at the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>We <i>could</i> represent the two cases as</p>

<pre><code>    []              an empty array
    [$head, $tail]  an array representing a tuple of head and tail</code></pre>

<p>However, in this book we'll use objects declared using <code>Moose</code> wherever we can. This will give more straight-forward code, as well as having a lot of power that we'll need when we go on to more complex scenarios.</p>

<p>Note that all of the code examples are implemented and tested at <code>https://github.com/osfameron/pure-fp-book/tree/master/code</code>, so you can easily check how things hang together. If there's no implementation in your language, then please fork the code on github and contribute!</p>

<p>As we saw, there are two types of list. From an Object Oriented perspective, we might think of implementing this with an Abstract Base Class (i.e. one that only acts as a superclass, to tie together related functionality and type information, but which can't be instantiated into a <code>-&gt;new</code> object; and then with concrete subclasses. The Moosey way to do this is to use a <code>Role</code> (also known as a trait, and similar in many ways to Ruby's mixins).</p>

<pre><code>    use MooseX::Declare;
    BEGIN { role_type &#39;List&#39; }

    role List {
        requires &#39;head&#39;;
        requires &#39;tail&#39;;
    }

    class List::Link with List {
        has head =&gt; ( is =&gt; &#39;ro&#39;, isa =&gt; &#39;Any&#39; );
        has tail =&gt; ( is =&gt; &#39;ro&#39;, isa =&gt; &#39;List&#39; ),
    }

    class List::Empty with List {
        method head { die &quot;Can&#39;t take head of empty list!&quot; }
        method tail { die &quot;Can&#39;t take tail of empty list!&quot; }
    }</code></pre>

<p>With this code, we could already create a list, but it'd be a little verbose:</p>

<pre><code>    my $list = List::Link-&gt;new(
        head =&gt; &#39;h&#39;,
        tail =&gt; List::Link-&gt;new(
            head =&gt; &#39;e&#39;,
            tail =&gt; List::Link-&gt;new(...</code></pre>

<p>So let's add a little sugar. We'll create a function <code>fromArray</code> that we'll call like so:</p>

<pre><code>    my $list = List-&gt;fromArray( 1..10 );</code></pre>

<p>As lists are a recursive data structure, it makes sense to implement this in a recursive way so:</p>

<ul>

<li>If the array is empty, we return an empty list.</li>

<li>If the array has one element, we'll link that with the empty list</li>

<li>... and, in general, we'll link the first element in the array with the result of calling <code>fromArray</code> on the remainder of the array.</li>

</ul>

<p>Typically in Perl we might use a condition like <code>if</code> to distinguish between these cases. But in both Functional and Object Oriented programming, it's often much more elegant to use pattern matching (of which "multiple dispatch" is a variant.) <code>Moose</code> provides a rather nice and flexible way of declaring these, and we'll take advantage of it.</p>

<pre><code>    use MooseX::MultiMethods;

    # can be called as a class method, or on an object
    multi method fromArray ($class:) {
        return List::Empty-&gt;new;
    }
    multi method fromArray ($class: $head, @tail) {
        return List::Link-&gt;new(
            head =&gt; $head,
            tail =&gt; $class-&gt;fromArray(@tail),
        );
    }</code></pre>

<p>This kind of recursive code is very elegant. But there is a teensy little problem: dynamic languages were never designed for this kind of code structure, and that means that, by default, they do have a few little hiccups that we need to be aware of.</p>

<h3>Tail calls and recursion limits</h3>

<p>In the method <code>fromArray</code> above, we recurse back into the same method until we've converted all the elements of the array into a List. Every time we do this, we are making a new method call, which is added to the call stack. This requires storing information about the caller, and to support these very dynamic languages, may require quite a <i>lot</i> of information... And finally, once we get to the base case, and are ready to return the result, the interpreter will then have to hop back through the stack, one level at a time, till it gets back to the top, passing the result information up all the way to the top.</p>

<p>If we make many of these recursive calls, then the interpreter may start to complain about what we're doing. For example, in Perl:</p>

<pre><code>    Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;List::fromArray&quot; at foo.pl line 20</code></pre>

<p>There are ways to eliminate these warnings</p>

<pre><code>    no warnings &#39;recursion&#39;;
    $DB::deep = 100_000_000; # some big number, greater than maximum 
                             # number of recursions</code></pre>

<p>But that would only be papering over the synptoms, the root problem would remain: we may blow all the memory allocated to the call stack, and the interpreter may crash.</p>

<p>In languages like Scheme and Haskell, which are built around recursive data structures, the compilers will naturally do Tail Call Elimination. This means that if the last action in a routine is to call another method (often, but not always, the current method) then you can simply jump to that method, without having to add the overhead of storing the call on the stack.</p>

<p>Though Perl can't (yet?) do this kind of optimization automatically, there are two modules on CPAN by Yuval Koogman that will allow you to handle this elegantly, <code>Sub::Call::Tail</code> and <code>Sub::Call::Recur</code>. The latter is faster, but only handles function calls that recurse into themselves. The former can handle tail calls to any subroutine, and also object methods, so we'll use that.</p>

<p>By default, <code>Sub::Call::Tail</code> exports a function called <code>tail</code>. As our List class already has a method <code>tail</code> (meaning something quite different), this could confuse both the reader and <code>perl</code> itself. So we'll take advantage of the facility to import an aliased function, and call it <code>tail_call</code> instead, which makes it much clearer!</p>

<pre><code> # the slightly nicer &#39;use&#39; line is implemented in 
 # https://github.com/osfameron/sub-call-tail release pending ;-)

    # take that, recursion!
    use Sub::Import &#39;Sub::Call::Tail&#39; tail =&gt; { -as =&gt; &#39;tail_call&#39; };
    # use Sub::Call::Tail tail =&gt; { -as =&gt; &#39;tail_call&#39;};

    multi method fromArray ($self: $head, @tail) {
        tail_call List::Link-&gt;new(
            head =&gt; $head,
            tail =&gt; $self-&gt;fromArray(@tail),
        );
    }</code></pre>

<p>There are similar workarounds available for Python, Ruby, and Javascript. They will usually use a <code>goto</code> statement in some form, perhaps a structured one that either jumps back to the beginning of the block.</p>

<p>(Interestingly, though the Perl hack in <code>Sub::Call::Tail</code> is implemented with a <code>goto &function</code> call, which shares the same name as the reviled control-flow operation, it's substantially cleaner than you might fear. This type of <code>goto</code> simply replaces the currently running subroutine with a new one, a little like Unix's <code>exec</code> switches to a new process.)</p>

<h3>Getting data out of a list</h3>

<h4>Indexing into the list</h4>

<p>While arrays and lists both store collections of data, the representations make certain tasks easier or more difficult. Accessing an item positionally, for example, is trivial with an array:</p>

<pre><code>     0  1  2  3  4 
    [h][e][l][l][o]

    To access item number 3, find the beginning of the array, and get the 
    contents of the box 3 positions to the right.</code></pre>

<p>With a list, on the other hand, we don't have an easy way to jump to another element, as each cell is stored in a different location in memory.</p>

<pre><code>    [h.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o.]-&gt;()</code></pre>

<p>Instead we need to visit each cell in turn until we arrive at the right <code>head</code> element.</p>

<p>Obviously, we can't index into an Empty list:</p>

<pre><code>    multi method nth (List::Empty $self: Int $pos) { 
        die &quot;Can&#39;t index into an Empty list&quot;; 
    }</code></pre>

<p>And if we want the zero-th element of a list, then we're just looking for its head.</p>

<pre><code>    multi method nth (Int $pos where { $_ == 0 }) {
        return $self-&gt;head;
    }</code></pre>

<p>But if we've passed a positive integer, then we can simply recurse down the tail, looking for the <code>nth</code> of the next lowest integer, until we get to 0.</p>

<pre><code>    multi method nth (Int $pos where { $_ &gt; 0 }) {
        tail_call $self-&gt;tail-&gt;nth( $pos - 1 );
    }</code></pre>

<p>Notice how we've specified all the valid ways to call this method. If we call <code>$list-&gt;nth("foo")</code> or <code>$list-&gt;nth(-1)</code> then Moose will throw an error for us automatically!</p>

<h4>Converting back to array</h4>

<p>It may sometimes be convenient to flatten our List structure back to a native array. We could do this again with recursion.</p>

<pre><code>    multi method toArray_recursive (List::Empty $self:) { 
        return ()
    }
    multi method toArray_recursive (List::Link $self:) {
        return ($self-&gt;head, $self-&gt;tail-&gt;toArray_recursive);
    }</code></pre>

<p>But notice how we don't have a convenient function to make a tail call on. The <code>toArray</code> method is called, but as <i>part</i> of the expression only. In general, there are two ways to handle this:</p>

<ul>

<li>convert the function into a tail-recursive one, by extracting out the stack</li>

<li>convert the function into an iterative one, that manages its own stack</li>

</ul>

<p>The best general tutorial to these methods using a dynamic programming language may well be Mark Jason Dominus's <i>Higher Order Perl</i>, now freely available online at http://hop.perl.plover.com/ (though it's worth buying, whatever your programming language of choice).</p>

<p>We'll just briefly look at an example of each technique.</p>

<h4>converting the function into a tail-recursive one</h4>

<p>We'll need to extract the returned <code>@array</code> and instead pass it onwards within the tail call.</p>

<pre><code>    multi method toArray_stack (List::Empty $self: @stack) {
        return @stack;
    }
    multi method toArray_stack (List::Link $self: @stack) {
        tail_call $self-&gt;tail-&gt;toArray_stack(@stack, $self-&gt;head);
    }</code></pre>

<h4>converting the function into an iterative one</h4>

<p>Here we will entirely eschew the idea of making a recursive function call, and instead loop through the list using a classic imperative programming statement, the <code>while</code> loop. We'll also manage our own stack, as a variable <code>@stack</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    method toArray_iterative () {
        my @stack;
        my $list = $self;
        while ($list-&gt;isa(&#39;List::Link&#39;)) {
            push @stack, $list-&gt;head;
            $list = $list-&gt;tail;
        }
        return @stack;
    }</code></pre>

<h3>Transformations on lists</h3>

<p>Every standard library for manipulating lists should come with a number of basic transformations, for mapping all the values with a function, filtering them according to some criteria, or reducing the collection to a single value. We'll look at each of these in turn.</p>

<h4>Applying a function to a list: <code>map</code></h4>

<p>We often want to apply a function to all elements of a collection. For example, we may have a list of user records, and we want a list of full names.</p>

<p>The dynamic languages, for the most part, have already borrowed this functionality from the world of Functional Programming, and often call it <code>map</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    my @users = (
        {
            first_name =&gt; &#39;Bob&#39;,
            last_name  =&gt; &#39;Smith&#39;,
        },
        {
            first_name =&gt; &#39;Aisha&#39;,
            last_name  =&gt; &#39;Chaudhury&#39;,
        }
    );

    use signatures;
    sub full_name ($user) {
        return join &#39; &#39; =&gt; 
            $user-&gt;{first_name},
            $user-&gt;{last_name};
    }

    my @full_names = map full_name($_), @users;</code></pre>

<p>To define map for a linked list, we of course define it recursively!</p>

<pre><code>    multi method map (List::Empty $self: CodeRef $f) { 
        return $self;
    }
    multi method map (List::Link $self: CodeRef $f) {
        tail_call $self-&gt;new( 
            head =&gt; $f-&gt;($self-&gt;head),
            tail =&gt; $self-&gt;tail-&gt;map( $f )
        );
    }</code></pre>

<p>and later:</p>

<pre><code>    my $users = List-&gt;fromArray(@users);

    my $names = $users-&gt;map( \&amp;full_name );</code></pre>

<h5>Functors</h5>

<p>Note how we started with a function that operated on a single value:</p>

<pre><code>    full_name :: { first_name, last_name } -&gt; &quot;Full name&quot;</code></pre>

<p>And we've ended with one that operates on whole collections:</p>

<pre><code>    map(full_name) :: [List of {...}] -&gt; [List of &quot;Full name&quot;]</code></pre>

<p>Often, in the world of FP, we'll call this kind of operation a Functor. You'll often see the operation that we just defined as <code>map</code> called <code>fmap</code> instead (i.e. Functor Map). Converting a function that operates on a single value to one that operates on a collection (or any other type of container) is called <i>lifting</i> the function.</p>

<h4><code>filter</code>ing the list</h4>

<p>Another key operation on any collection type is to filter them by some criteria. All the dynamic languages offer this facility for their native types, usually calling them <code>grep</code> or <code>filter</code>, or in some cases using a more general facility called List Comprehensions. We'll implement the simple filter case, again recursively.</p>

<pre><code>    multi method filter (List::Empty $self: CodeRef $f) { 
        return $self;
    }
    multi method filter (List::Link $self: CodeRef $f) {
        my $head = $self-&gt;head;
        if ($f-&gt;($head)) {
            tail_call $self-&gt;new( 
                head =&gt; $head,
                tail =&gt; $self-&gt;tail-&gt;filter( $f ),
            );
        }
        else {
            tail_call $self-&gt;tail-&gt;filter( $f );
        }
    }</code></pre>

<p>So, we could now write</p>

<pre><code>    # TODO TEST
    use signatures;
    my $odd_numbers = List-&gt;fromArray(1..100)-&gt;filter(
        sub ($n) { $n % 2 }
    );</code></pre>

<h4><code>fold</code></h4>

<p>Folds are the result of repeatedly applying an operation to every pair of values in a List until you get a single value. An example could be finding the sum of a list of numbers.</p>

<pre><code>    sum (1,2,3,4,5) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5</code></pre>

<p>We could think of the sum as:</p>

<pre><code>    1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 5))) &lt;-- a right fold</code></pre>

<p>or as</p>

<pre><code>    (((1 + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5 &lt;-- a left fold</code></pre>

<p>Oddly, these two folds, <code>foldr</code> and <code>foldl</code> have rather different characteristics: sometimes one will be faster, or will never complete.</p>

<p>With all these recursive algorithms, we have to consider the "base case", which for lists means "what happens with an empty list?" The typical way to do this is to also include a parameter which is an <i>identity</i> value. For a <code>sum</code> operation, this would be <code>0</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    sub add ($x,$y) { $x + $y },
    sub sum ($nums) {
        return $nums-&gt;fold( \&amp;add, 0 );
    }</code></pre>

<p>Whereas for a multiplicative <code>product</code> it would be <code>1</code></p>

<pre><code>    sub multiply ($x,$y) { $x * $y },
    sub product ($nums) {
        return $nums-&gt;fold( \&amp;multiply, 1 );
    }</code></pre>

<p>Though in both these cases, the fold's input and output are the same type of value, folds allow the result to be a different type entirely. In general, we call the result an <i>accumulator</i>, as it accumulates the folder data as we progress through the list.</p>

<p>Let's have a look at the left-fold first.</p>

<pre><code>    multi method foldl (List::Empty $self: CodeRef $f, $acc) {
        return $acc;
    }
    multi method foldl (List::Link $self: CodeRef $f, $acc) {
        tail_call $self-&gt;tail-&gt;foldl($f, $f-&gt;($self-&gt;head, $acc));
    }</code></pre>

<p>So the left fold is a typical recursive function. Note how we have to pass the accumulator to the first call - often we'd call this the <i>init</i> argument.</p>

<p>While it's easy to see what the init argument should be, in many cases, you may have noticed that my original example omitted one:</p>

<pre><code>    sum (1,2,3,4,5) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5</code></pre>

<p>In this case we can simply use the first element in the list to start things off. This obviously wouldn't work for an empty list! Often such a fold is labelled with the number <code>1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    # TODO test
    method foldl1 (List::Link $self: CodeRef $f, $acc) {
        return $self-&gt;tail-&gt;foldl($f, $self-&gt;head);
    }</code></pre>

<p>As we've specified that <code>$self</code> must be a linking list, the method will fail entirely on an empty list.</p>

<p># TODO case where we have an accumulator, rather than a typical binop</p>

<p>Now let's have a look at a right fold. The empty case is, of course, the same:</p>

<pre><code>    multi method foldr (List::Empty $self: CodeRef $f, $acc) {
        return $acc;
    }</code></pre>

<p>But note how, unlike <code>foldl</code>, the right fold isn't tail recursive:</p>

<pre><code>    multi method foldr (List::Link $self: CodeRef $f, $acc) {
        tail_call $f-&gt;(
            $self-&gt;head,
            $self-&gt;tail-&gt;foldr($f, $acc),
        );
    }</code></pre>

<p>Though we have a tail call, it's only on the folding function <code>$f</code>. The actual call back into <code>foldr</code> isn't in the tail position, where it can be easily optimized, but rather <i>inside</i> the call to this folding function.</p>

<ul>

<li>EXERCISE:</li>

<p>Try to optimize <code>foldr</code> by making it tail-recursive or iterative, as we saw above with <code>toArray</code></p>

</ul>

<p>Later, when we look at infinite lazy lists, we'll come back to another little tweak that languages like Haskell use to optimize right folds.</p>

<h3>Modifying the list</h3>

<p>We noted earlier that an array was represented as a contiguous area of memory while a list is a series of nodes that point to each other</p>

<pre><code>    ARRAY:
     0  1  2  3  4 
    [h][e][l][l][o]

    LIST
    0     1     2     3     4     5
    [h.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o.]-&gt;()</code></pre>

<p>We saw above that the code to access the <code>nth</code> element of a list was rather more complicated than for an array. Similarly, other operations are more (or less) complicated. We'll look at updating a single element, inserting a new one, and deletion in turn, comparing the trade-offs between an array and a list.</p>

<h4>Updating an element</h4>

<p>If we want to change our list to <code>"hullo"</code> instead, then this is easy with an array.</p>

<pre><code>    $array[1] = &quot;u&quot;;

    ARRAY is now:
    [h][u][l][l][o]</code></pre>

<p>Of course we've now "lost" the original representation of "hello", because the contents of that array have been entirely written over. Now, we might want to do the same thing with a list</p>

<pre><code>    $list-&gt;mutateAt(1, &#39;u&#39;);

    LIST
    0     1     2     3     4     5
    [h.]-&gt;[u.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o.]-&gt;()
           ^
           changed in-place</code></pre>

<p>And of course we'd do it recursively:</p>

<pre><code>    # NOT TESTED
    multi method mutateAt (List::Empty $self: Int $pos, $new) { 
        die &quot;Can&#39;t mutate an Empty list&quot;; 
    }
    multi method mutateAt (Int $pos where { $_ == 0 }, $new) {
        $self-&gt;head($new);
    }
    multi method mutateAt (Int $pos where { $_ &gt; 0 }, $new) {
        tail_call $self-&gt;tail-&gt;mutateAt($pos - 1, $new);
    }</code></pre>

<p>However, that would be a <i>mutation</i> of a value, and in this book, we're mostly interested in <i>immutable</i>, pure data structures. Note that we even declared our attributes with read-only (<code>'ro'</code>) accessors.</p>

<pre><code>    class List::Link with List {
        has head =&gt; ( is =&gt; &#39;ro&#39;, isa =&gt; &#39;Any&#39; );
        has tail =&gt; ( is =&gt; &#39;ro&#39;, isa =&gt; &#39;List&#39; ),
    }</code></pre>

<p>If we relax these to <code>'rw'</code>, we could make the <code>mutateAt</code> code work. This is how you might typically work with linked lists in a language like <code>C</code>. But of course such a list shares the disadvantage of the array mutation - that we have now lost the original <code>"hello"</code> sequence. Let's see if we can do better.</p>

<p>So, we want to retain the <code>'e'</code> node, but avoid it, like so:</p>

<pre><code>    LIST
    0     1     2     3     4     5
    [h.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o.]-&gt;()
        \     /
          [u.]</code></pre>

<p>But of course the node <code>'h'</code> can't point to two tails! So we could relink it entirely:</p>

<pre><code>    LIST
    0     1     2     3     4     5
    [h.] x{e.}-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o.]-&gt;()
        \     /
          [u.]</code></pre>

<p>But of course that means <i>mutating</i> the tail of the the list <code>'h'</code>, which we've promised we wouldn't do... immutable data-structures are <i>hard</i>!</p>

<p>The trick turns out to be to <i>copy</i> everything before the element we're changing.</p>

<pre><code>    LIST
    0     1     2     3     4     5
    [h.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o.]-&gt;()
              /
    [h.]-&gt;[u.]</code></pre>

<p>We now have <i>2</i> different nodes that both contain the value <code>'h'</code> in their head, but which are in fact different lists: they have entirely different tails. Note, though, that they converge at <code>'l'</code>, so we only need to copy part of the list.</p>

<pre><code>    # NOT TESTED
    multi method updateAt (List::Empty $self: Int $pos, $new) { 
        die &quot;Can&#39;t update an Empty list&quot;; 
    }
    multi method updateAt (Int $pos where { $_ == 0 }, $new) {
        List::Link-&gt;new({
            head =&gt; $new,
            tail =&gt; $self-&gt;tail,
        });
    }
    multi method updateAt (Int $pos where { $_ &gt; 0 }, $new) {
        tail_call List::Link-&gt;new({
            head =&gt; $self-&gt;head,
            tail =&gt; $self-&gt;tail-&gt;updateAt($pos - 1, $new);
        });
    }</code></pre>

<p>If you think about it, this method is following the same pattern of <code>nth</code>, except that instead of just descending the list till we get to the element we want, we copy the list as we go. Then, once we get to position <code>0</code>, we link this copied part of the list with the updated element, and the rest of the list.</p>

<p>All this copying may seem inefficient. If you have to do multiple updates, then you will end up copying at least the <i>beginning</i> of the list each time. Tellingly, Haskell's <i>Prelude</i> (the standard library), with a very rich set of functions to manipulate linked lists. entirely omits any version of <code>updateAt</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, a linked list, by default isn't the optimal structure for random access. However, we have seen that the benefit of using an immutable structure is that we get to keep the old and new versions of a structure at the same time, and with minimal memory usage, because of the sharing of data between the two structures.</p>

<p>This technique of data sharing where possible (and cloning with updated values where not) will be a common tool, so it is worth getting to grips with this simple example first, so we'll look now at inserting and deleting elements from a list.</p>

<p>Of course, other data structures may well be more appropriate for your task, for example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Array</li>

<p>Yes, they're mutable, but in some cases, they will still be the appropriate structure.</p>

<li>Zippers</li>

<p>We'll look at these shortly - these allow us to update a list immediately, in place, in constant time. Especially useful if you will be doing multiple updates.</p>

<li>Trees</li>

<p>We'll look at these in detail in the next chapter</p>

</ul>

<p>But first, we'll look at an operation where arrays are less convenient: insertion of an element into a list</p>

<h4>Inserting a new element</h4>

<p>We already saw that arrays are contiguous. We will have reserved a block of memory for the array, so to insert into it, we first have to copy all of the data to the right, and finally insert the element. So, for example, to insert the missing letter into the alphabet, we'd do:</p>

<pre><code>    ARRAY:
     0  1  2  3 
    [a][b][d][e]

    copy
     0  1  2  3  4
    [a][b][d][d][e]

    update
     0  1  2  3  4 
    [a][b][c][d][e]</code></pre>

<p>That looks nice and straight-forward: but of course the array didn't have this extra element reserved! In the dynamic languages what we call an <i>array</i> is usually in fact a <i>dynamic array</i> or <i>vector</i>, which will resize itself behind the scenes. So in the above example, when we try to add a new element to the vector, our insert algorithm must first realise that we're growing the array, and then allocate a new block of space (we'll double the storage space here, to avoid having to re-allocate too often).</p>

<pre><code>    ARRAY:          NEW
     0  1  2  3     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    [a][b][d][e]   [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]</code></pre>

<p>Then we'll copy the data to the left of the insertion</p>

<pre><code>    ARRAY:          NEW
     0  1  2  3     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    [a][b][d][e]   [a][b][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]</code></pre>

<p>and to the right</p>

<pre><code>    ARRAY:          NEW
     0  1  2  3     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    [a][b][d][e]   [a][b][ ][d][e][ ][ ][ ]</code></pre>

<p>and of course, add the inserted element. (Now, finally, we can de-allocate the old array from memory).</p>

<pre><code>                    NEW
                    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
                   [a][b][c][d][e][ ][ ][ ]</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this is quite a lot of work, and that's the reason why we pre-allocated a larger range of memory than needed. The next time we insert a value, we can use our first, simpler version, and only need to resize again once we need more than 8 elements. Of course, this does mean that we also need to keep track of the number of items in the array:</p>

<pre><code>                    NEW
                    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7    #count
                   [a][b][c][d][e][ ][ ][ ]    5</code></pre>

<p>Let's look at how we'd insert an element into a list:</p>

<pre><code>    LIST
    0     1     2     3     4
    [a.]-&gt;[b.]-&gt;[d.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;()</code></pre>

<p>We need to re-point the link from <code>b</code> to a new list with value <code>c</code> that points to the remainder of the list <code>d</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    LIST
    0     1      3     4     5
    [a.]-&gt;[b.]   [d.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;()
             \   /
             [c.]
             2</code></pre>

<p>If we were using a mutable data-structure, we'd do exactly this, and just mutate the references to point to the right place. With a pure, immutable list, we'll take advantage of sharing as before (by pointing to the <code>e</code> list, which remains unchanged) but we'll also have to copy the start of the list.</p>

<pre><code>    LIST
    0     1     2     3     4     5
    [a.]-&gt;[b.]-------&gt;[d.]-&gt;[e.]-&gt;()
                    /
    [a.]-&gt;[b.]-&gt;[c.]</code></pre>

<p>The insertion code is quite simple, and follows the same structure as <code>updateAt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    # NOT TESTED
    multi method insertAt (List::Empty $self: Int $pos, $new) { 
        die &quot;Can&#39;t insert into an Empty list&quot;; 
    }
    multi method insertAt (Int $pos where { $_ == 0 }, $new) {
        List::Link-&gt;new({
            head =&gt; $new,
            tail =&gt; $self,
        });
    }
    multi method insertAt (Int $pos where { $_ &gt; 0 }, $new) {
        tail_call List::Link-&gt;new({
            head =&gt; $self-&gt;head,
            tail =&gt; $self-&gt;tail-&gt;insertAt($pos - 1, $new);
        });
    }</code></pre>

<p>Just as before, we copy the head of the list up until the point we want to insert. In fact, there is only difference between the routines! Instead of linking the list to the original position's <i>tail</i>, we link to the whole list.</p>

<h4>Deleting an element</h4>

<p>Deletion from an array will always involve shifting the elements after the one deleted to the left, and then decreasing the element count.</p>

<pre><code>    array
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
   [h][a][l][l][o][ ][ ][ ]  #5

   [h][a][l][o][ ][ ][ ][ ]  #4</code></pre>

<p>At this point, the algorithm might choose to reallocate the memory, to shrink the size of data stored.</p>

<p>Again, using linked lists, this could be trivial.</p>

<pre><code>    LIST
    0     1     2     3     4     5
    [h.]-&gt;[a.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[l.]-&gt;[o.]-&gt;()

    [h.]-&gt;[a.]-&gt;[l.]-------&gt;[o.]-&gt;()</code></pre>

<p>But again, if we want to use immutable lists, we'll have a copy and share, as before.</p>

<pre><code>    # NOT TESTED
    multi method deleteAt (List::Empty $self: Int $pos) { 
        die &quot;Can&#39;t delete from an Empty list&quot;; 
    }
    multi method deleteAt (Int $pos where { $_ == 0 }) {
        return $self-&gt;tail;
    }
    multi method deleteAt (Int $pos where { $_ &gt; 0 }) {
        tail_call List::Link-&gt;new({
            head =&gt; $self-&gt;head,
            tail =&gt; $self-&gt;tail-&gt;deleteAt($pos - 1, $new);
        });
    }</code></pre>

<p>This follows the same structure again, except that once we get to the element we want to delete, we simply skip over its <code>head</code> and return its <code>tail</code> instead.</p>

<h4>Copying</h4>

<p>TODO: a) we "copied" tail of list by just pointing at it. "copy" of first part was in fact a change. But a *deep copy* of a Pure FP structure is as simple as referring to it. TODO b) MooseX::Singleton</p>

<h4>Comparing the array and list approaches</h4>

<p>The pros and cons of each approach might include:</p>

<ul>

<li>List</li>

<p>simple implementation for each case</p>

<li>List</li>

<p>immutable data - the old version still exists, if you need it</p>

<li>List</li>

<p>no having to shunt the right hand side of the list around in memory</p>

<li>List</li>

<p>no having to reallocate and move the entire structure as it grows and shrinks</p>

<li>Array</li>

<p>Very fast for updating single elements in place</p>

<li>Array</li>

<p>No having to copy the left-hand side of the array each time</p>

<li>Array</li>

<p>The result will still be an array - this may be important if you will be doing a lot of random access into the array.</p>

</ul>

<p>It is important to be aware of these trade-offs when deciding whether to look beyond your language's default dynamic array type, or not.</p>

<p>But of course, so far we've only seen lists that are linked in one direction (also known as "singly linked lists".) To be able to fairly compare lists to arrays, we'll now look at at a variant that can be used to traverse the list in both directions.</p>

<h3>Doubly linked lists</h3>
