Draft plan for book.

1. Introduction

    - Why purely functional data-structures?
        - easier to reason about
        - higher-level features: Undo
        - concurrency
        - memory sharing
        - case study: Git
    - Survey of existing work (Okasaki, etc.)
    - Aim of book 
        - to provide a grounding to Purely Functional data-structures 
        - for the working programmer (not for CompSci audience)
        - with examples in Modern Perl

2. Lists

    - A mutable list: Perl's array (a Vector type)
        - advantages
        - disadvantages
    - Singly-linked lists
        - Mutable versus Immutable
        - code
    - Doubly-linked lists?
        - mutable... immutable?
        - pointers
        - code
        - rewrite with Data::Zipper

    - Exercise: implement a turing machine with a zipper onto an infinite
        (in both directions) list

    - Show me the Code!: simple code-examples of the code presented in the
        chapter, as review summary, or for the impatient.

3. Objects, Trees and Dictionaries

    - Immutable Moose objects
        - updating child objects: the problem
        - Zipper!
    - Compare trees
    - Dictionaries
        - Mutable versus Immutable
        - Hash
        - Tree.  Why?
    - Simple Binary tree
        - List to tree
        - Binary search
        - Interlude: explanation of O(log n)
    - Balanced trees
        - When trees go wrong
        - Red black algorithm
        - Pattern matching
        - Insertion
        - Deletion
    - Zippers

    - Exercise: ???

    - Show me the code!

4. Strings

    - Mutable strings
    - Piece-table / rope
        - backed by singly-linked list
        - backed by red-black-tree
            - an Enfilade!
        - Zipper
    
    - Exercise: ???

    - Show me the code!
    
5. Grids

    (Not certain how to approach this yet!)

    - Mutable grids
        - Array of Arrays
    - How to do grids immutably?
        - List of lists?
        - Dictionary lookup of (x,y) coordinates
        - Quad-tree
        - intersecting Row/Column trees
        - Zippers?

        
    - Exercise: ???

    - Show me the code!

6. Graphs

    - OO style mutable graph, modeled with nodes
        - how to implement as purely-functional...?
        - ... while retaining sharing
    - Adjacency matrix
        - algorithms

    - Exercise: ???

    - Show me the code!
